# Motorcycle Mania

An online 'catalog' of motorcycles.

This is an example project in static html, css and js. The goal is to exercise
HTML and CSS, file paths, and the fundamentals of static web sites. It's also
foundation for illustrating the need for server-side html generation, aka
"dynamic web pages."
